### Project Description

The grocery store website project aims to establish a comprehensive e-commerce platform dedicated to providing users with a seamless experience for browsing, exploring detailed product information, and making purchases of grocery items. It encompasses both backend and frontend implementations to ensure smooth interaction between users and the platform.
Features

The backend of the system is structured using Flask API and SQLAlchemy ORM, facilitating robust database interactions. It incorporates models for User, Product, and Order with defined relationships, allowing for complex data management such as one-to-many and many-to-many associations. CRUD operations are fully implemented for Orders, enabling users to manage their transactions efficiently.

On the frontend, the system leverages React along with React Router for intuitive client-side routing and navigation. A dynamic Navbar provides easy access to various sections including Home, About, Categories (Vegetables, Fruits, Grains), Sign Up, Login, and User Profile. The Homepage features a prominently placed search bar to facilitate quick and efficient product searches. Detailed product listings are displayed on the Products Page, each linking to comprehensive Product Details Pages for in-depth information. Additionally, the website includes an About Page outlining its objectives, a Contact Page with inquiry forms for direct communication, and a User Profile section allowing users to manage their profile details and view their order history. User authentication is seamlessly handled with functionalities for login, signup, and logout using tokens stored in localStorage.

### Project Description
The Quickpick Grocery Store website project aims to establish a comprehensive e-commerce platform dedicated to providing users with a seamless experience for browsing, exploring detailed product information, and making purchases of grocery items. It encompasses both backend and frontend implementations to ensure smooth interaction between users and the platform.

### Features
  #### Backend
The backend of the system is structured using Flask API and SQLAlchemy ORM, facilitating robust database interactions. It incorporates models for User, Product, and Order with defined relationships, allowing for complex data management such as one-to-many and many-to-many associations. CRUD operations are fully implemented for Orders, enabling users to manage their transactions efficiently.

* User Management: Create, read, update, and delete user accounts with role-based access control (admin and customer roles).
* Product Management: Create, read, update, and delete products with detailed information such as name, price, category, stock quantity, description, and supplier.
* Order Management: Create, read, update, and delete orders, associating them with users and products.
* Authentication: Secure login using email or phone number with hashed passwords and JWT for token-based authentication.

 #### Frontend 
The front end leverages React along with React Router for intuitive client-side routing and navigation.

* Dynamic Navbar: Easy access to various sections including Home, About, Categories (Vegetables, Fruits, Grains), Sign Up, Login, and User Profile.
* Homepage: Features a prominently placed search bar for quick and efficient product searches.
* Product Pages: Detailed product listings with comprehensive Product Details Pages for in-depth information.
* About Page: Outlines the objectives of the website.
* Contact Page: Includes inquiry forms for direct communication.
* User Profile: Allows users to manage their profile details and view their order history.
* Authentication: Functionalities for login, signup, and logout using tokens stored in localStorage.

#### Project Solutions
The project addresses several key solutions to ensure its effectiveness and usability:

=> Comprehensive Platform: Provides detailed product listings complete with images, descriptions, and pricing, catering to informed consumer decision-making.
=> User-Friendly Interface: Ensures ease of navigation with a responsive navbar and structured page layouts, enhancing user experience across all sections of the website.
=>Secure Transactions: Implements robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, safeguarding user interactions and transactions against unauthorized access.
=> Effective Communication Channels: Integrates contact forms to facilitate seamless communication between users and administrators, ensuring prompt responses to inquiries and feedback.
